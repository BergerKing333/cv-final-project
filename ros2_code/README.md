For Alex Slinger and Sanaz; you don't need to use the code in this folder. 
This folder is direct copy paste from the Lunabotics repo where I have this code working for our demo.
In theory you could set yourself up to run this, and if you want to, I can supply the RosBags,
but it will be much easier to run the non-ros versions of these scripts, which I'll also include.
